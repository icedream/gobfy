# gobfy

gobfy means "go brainf\*\*k yourself!"

Rude and rudimentary quick interpreter for Brainf\*\*k programs.

**This is no longer maintained.** This is just here for the silly purposes of archiving old code that I used to make because I was bored.

The code is however fully functional and will successfully run Brainf\*\*k programs!
